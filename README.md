# Data Mining Approach for Movie Success Prediction

The system was developed using Python (3.10.4), Pip (22.0.4) and Jupyter Notebook (6.4.10).

### Required Python Packages
  - Numpy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-Learn

### Applied Algorithms
  - k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN)
  - Random Forest (RF)
  - Logistic Regression (LR)

### Dataset
  The Dataset has 38 dimensions and more than 3700 records.

### How to Operate
  In order to get the prediction scores for a new movie, update the movie data in "PredictInput.csv" file and run the project from scratch. To get the necessary data required about the movie, see that movie's IMDb page.
